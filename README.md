#UNSW CSESoc Event Form

A system utilising an Express backend and React frontend that allows members of the UNSW CSESoc Executive Team to organise events and automatically send out required information to the correct channels. 

To ensure that you have met the dependancies:
- Make sure you have a version of node.js >= 6.0.0
- cd into the `client` directory and run `npm install`
- cd back into the root project directory and run `npm install`. You should get no errors!
- type `npm start` to run both the server backend and frontend

TODO
- Integrate with Google Calendar
- Add Login functionality
- Connect the backend to our Bark servers to allow scanning of student IDs and tracking of attendance at events.
